let's see ... we have a scarf for skywalker, right?
and perfume for the Princess? (yeah)
what about Han Solo?  couldn't we get him ear muffs
that just leaves one big problem ... the Wookie
uh could we give him a  comb?  we gave him a comb last year


0:22 Chorus1
O
What can you get a wookie for christmas?
when he already owns a comb?
What can you get
in a hurry
for a furry
kind of friend like that
to take home?

0:37 Verse1
Oh
he doesn't need a tie clip
and he doesn't use shaving foam
so
what can you get a wookie for christmas
when he already owns a comb

0:50
(it's really a problem)

:Chorus2
What can you get a wookie for christmas
when he already owns a comb?
What can you get
in a hurry
for a furry
kind of friend like that
to take home?

1:05 Verse2
No
He'll never wear goulashes
or a hat upon his furry dome
so
what can you get a wookie for christmas
when he already owns a comb

1:19 Verse3
Let's give him love and understanding
good will to men
we wrap it all up in a bright colored ribbon
and we give it to him all over again

and that's what you get
a wookie for christmas
when he already owns a comb

1:41
===== start trim ====
(music)

2:10
love and understanding
good will to men
wrap it all up in a bright colored ribbon
and we'll give it to him all over again

2:25
(repeat echoed)
==== end trim =====

2:41
love and understanding
good will to men

and that's what you get
a wookie for christmas
when he already owns a comb

XLet's give him love and understanding
Xgood will to men
Xwrap it all up in bright colored ribbon
Xand give it to him all over again

2:55
that's what you get
a wookie for christmas
when he already owns a comb

(oh)

3:02
and that's what you get
a wookie for christmas
(groan)
when he already owns a comb
